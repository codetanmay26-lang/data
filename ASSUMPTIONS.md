# Aadhaar Pulse – Assumptions

- Biometric updates for age 18+ are treated as a proxy for Aadhaar maintenance demand
- Demographic updates combined with new enrolments indicate population movement
- Pincode is treated as an identifier and is not aggregated at state/district level
- Data accuracy is assumed as per UIDAI published datasets
